# 250final

The main code that I used for the plots on the poster are fastfulleff.py and fastfullhist.py. While making different plots, I sometimes just modified the code in the same python file of fastfulleff.py, so the fastfulleff.py now only shows the last version after the modifications. All the other files are trails I made to make other plots.
